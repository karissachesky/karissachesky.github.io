      <description>##Logistics
Introduction I have chosen the dataset “heart” for Project 2. This dataset was acquired from the public learning community Kaggle. I was inspired to study heart health data, and their modern trends, as they continue to greatly impact our modern world and my interests in medicine. “Heart” is a dataset containing variables that effect heart health and can ultimately lead to death. For example, such variables include “age”, “anemia”, “creatinine_phosphokinase”, “diabetes”, etc.</description>
