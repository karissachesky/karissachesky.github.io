      <description>Python is a coding language that I have recently explored in SDS 348. Several basic functions, similar to those utilized in R have been used, including indexing, slicing, and creating lists. Others include language features and conditionals, and can also be created. An example of some functions in python is as follows:
import numpy as np x=np.array([1,2,3]) x ## array([1, 2, 3]) print(x/2+1) ## [1.5 2. 2.5] x.shape ## (3,) mat1=np.</description>

Introduction I have chosen the dataset “heart” for Project 2. This dataset was acquired from the public learning community Kaggle. I was inspired to study heart health data, and their modern trends, as they continue to greatly impact our modern world and my interests in medicine. “Heart” is a dataset containing variables that effect heart health and can ultimately lead to death. For example, such variables include “age”, “anemia”, “creatinine_phosphokinase”, “diabetes”, etc.</description>
