Python is a coding language that I have recently explored in SDS 348. Several basic functions, similar to those utilized in R have been used, including indexing, slicing, and creating lists. Others include language features and conditionals, and can also be created. An example of some functions in python is as follows: 

```{python}
import numpy as np
x=np.array([1,2,3])
x

print(x/2+1)
x.shape

mat1=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
mat1

```

```{python}
for i in range(5):
 print(i)

for letter in "abcdefg":
 print(letter)
 
 x=np.random.randint(-10,10,1) #generate a random number from 1 to 10
if x>0:
 print("x is greater than zero!")
elif x==0:
 print("x is zero!")
else:
 print("x is less than zero!")



```
Reticulate can also be used to demonstrate how R and Python talk to each other and share information across code chunks. Specifically, with the reticulate package, the interplay between the two languages can be observed:

```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
UT<-"Texas"
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
UT="Longhron"
print(r.UT,UT) #access R-defined objects with r. 
```

```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(UT,py$UT)) #access Python-defined objects with py$
```
